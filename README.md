# KeyStoneH: Dynamic LoRA Architecture

A real-time adaptive routing system with 4-bit LoRA, contrastive representation learning, and dynamic gating mechanisms. This interactive demo showcases a paradigm shift in adaptive intelligence systems that achieves sub-millisecond inference latency without traditional LLM dependencies.

An agent that learns directly in your browser, forming transient chains of thought, is more than a feature. It forces us to investigate what intelligence is at its foundation: not parameter counts, but the fundamental interplay of memory, perception, and action.

We have achieved this by a critical separation: we decoupled the 'what' (the objective) and the 'why' (the intent) from the 'how' (the method).

In doing so, we have not built a single model. We have built an empty vessel, an agent capable of learning any "how" the world requires.

## Features

- **Real-time Adaptive Routing**: Dynamic centroid-based tool selection with instant convergence
- **4-bit LoRA Integration**: Efficient parameter updates with quantized gradients
- **Contrastive Learning**: Self-optimizing cognitive framework through continuous feedback
- **Dynamic Gating**: Exponential decay mechanisms for intelligent routing decisions
- **Zero Memory Allocation**: Lock-free architecture optimized for performance
- **Interactive Visualization**: 2D vector space projection with real-time centroid updates

## How It Works

KeyStoneH implements a novel approach to neural routing that combines:

1. **Centroid-Based Routing**: Each tool is represented by a high-dimensional centroid (512D) that evolves through user interaction
2. **4-bit LoRA Updates**: Efficient parameter adaptation using quantized gradients (-8 to +7 range)
3. **Contrastive Representation Learning**: Tools learn from positive and negative examples in a 512-token buffer
4. **Dynamic Gating**: Exponential decay mechanisms that adapt routing weights based on performance
5. **Immediate Convergence**: System stops iterating when similarity threshold (95%) is reached

## Technical Specifications

- **Vector Dimension**: 512D facet space
- **LoRA Parameters**: 128-dimensional A and B matrices per tool
- **Gating Size**: 128 dynamic gates with exponential decay
- **Convergence Threshold**: 95% similarity (configurable)
- **Learning Rate**: 0.08 (adjustable via advanced settings)
- **Memory Footprint**: 64KB SRAM simulation
- **Inference Latency**: Sub-millisecond routing decisions

## Interactive Demo

### Getting Started

1. **Open** `keystoneH.html` in your web browser
2. **Click** "Start Training" to begin the system
3. **Click** on any tool centroid (Navigate, Search, Analyze) to target it for convergence
4. **Watch** as the system adapts the centroid position in real-time
5. **Observe** convergence when similarity exceeds 95%

### Controls

- **Start Training**: Begin the adaptive routing process
- **Reset**: Reset all centroids and restart the demo
- **Pause**: Pause/resume the convergence process
- **Spacebar**: Quick start/pause toggle

### Advanced Settings

Click "Show Advanced Settings" to access:

- **Learning Rate**: Controls convergence speed (0.01 - 0.2)
- **Convergence Threshold**: Similarity threshold for stopping (80% - 100%)
- **Centroid Weight**: Weight for centroid updates (80% - 100%)

## Performance Metrics

The demo displays real-time performance data:

- **Routing Latency**: Microsecond-level inference times
- **Iterations**: Number of convergence steps
- **Confidence**: Current routing confidence percentage
- **Throughput**: Queries per second (QPS)

## Architecture Details

### Core Algorithms

1. **Cosine Similarity Routing**:
   ```javascript
   function cosineSimilarity(a, b) {
     let dot = 0, normA = 0, normB = 0;
     for (let i = 0; i < FACET_SIZE; i++) {
       dot += a[i] * b[i];
       normA += a[i] * a[i];
       normB += b[i] * b[i];
     }
     return dot / Math.sqrt(normA * normB);
   }
   ```

2. **4-bit LoRA Updates**:
   ```javascript
   function updateLoRA(toolId, grad, input) {
     for (let i = 0; i < 128; i++) {
       const deltaA = grad[i] * input[i] * learningRate;
       const quantizedA = Math.round(deltaA * 7); // 4-bit [-8, +7]
       tool.A[i] += quantizedA;
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Dynamic Gating with Exponential Decay**:
   ```javascript
   function updateGate(intent) {
     const alpha = Math.pow(0.5, iteration / HALF_LIFE_TOKENS);
     for (let i = 0; i < GATE_SIZE; i++) {
       gateValues[i] = gateValues[i] * alpha + scores[i] * (1 - alpha);
     }
   }
   ```

### Vector Space Visualization

The 2D projection uses a PCA-like approach:
- **X-axis**: `vec[0] * 1.2 + vec[1] * 0.8`
- **Y-axis**: `vec[2] * 1.1 + vec[3] * 0.9`
- **Normalization**: Scaled to [-1, 1] range for optimal visualization

## Key Innovations

1. **No LLM Dependency**: Pure vector mathematics for routing decisions
2. **Immediate Convergence**: Stops precisely when threshold is reached
3. **Memory Efficient**: 4-bit quantization reduces memory footprint by 75%
4. **Real-time Adaptation**: Centroids update continuously through user interaction
5. **Lock-free Architecture**: Atomic operations for thread-safe updates
